# Vanila-GAN-and-proGAN
Utilize GAN and proGAN to generate image belonged to class 8 - "ship" from CIFAR10 dataset

Reference: [Paper]https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196 |

## 1. Installation

(1) install all the necessary packages for the project mentioned in file `requirements.txt`

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(2) run file `GAN-proGAN.ipynb`

## 2. Dataset

the 2 Models were trained on 60,000 images from class 8 (ship) from dataset CIFAR10. In these models, we do not need test dataset, so, I merged both train and test into one dataset. 

## 3. Results

## 3.1. GAN

GAN is trained with 201 epoches, the result is improved significantly through epoches. Below is the images that the Generator create through out the training process:

Below is the loss behaviour of Generator and Discriminator during the training.

Images that is generated by the final model:

we can still see some ship shape is abnormal, however, most of the image can be seen as some how a ship. 

## 3.2 ProGAN

ProGAN is trained progessively with the gradually increased resolution of the generated images (the resolution of input for Discriminator is changed accordingly). structur of G and D is built based on the images below:
